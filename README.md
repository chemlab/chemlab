chemlab is a python library and a set of utilities built to ease the
life of the computational chemist. It takes inspiration from other
python scientific library such as numpy, scipy and matplotlib, and aims
to bring a consistent and simple API by following the python
guidelines.

Computational and theoretical chemistry is a huge field, and providing
a program that encompasses all aspect of it is an impossible task. The
spirit of chemlab is to provide a common ground from where you can
build specific programs. For this reason it includes an easily
extendable molecular viewer and flexible field-independent data
structures.

chemlab is looking for contributors, it includes a good documentation
and has an easy structure to get in. Feel free to send me anything that
you may do with chemlab, from supporting a new file format to writing
a new graphic renderer, even if you don'think it's perfect. Send me an
email or write an issue on the github page.
